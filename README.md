<h1>Vibe-coded version of the classic game Space Invaders</h1>

<b>The actual game is a Flask app in the subdirectory codespaces-flask-1!</b>

Play it on [dagfinn.pythonanywhere.com/](https://dagfinn.pythonanywhere.com/)

Or go to /codespaces-flask-1 and start with

python app.py

Given that you have installed the right dependencies.

(At the top level of this project it is more of a stub of a game that can be used to develop a different version.)
